%There are two challenges related to the conformal map: firstly, the conformal map does not
%always exist, especially for the map between general surfaces with high genus or the map with strong landmark matching restriction; for this kind of situation,
%we need to look for a map which is as close as possible to the conformal map, that is called extremal quasi-conformal map. Computing
%the extremal quasi-conformal map is not an easy task and only few works have been published for computing the extremal quasi-conformal
%map on the models which have simple topology homomorphic to the topological disk or sphere.
%
%Secondly, conformal map has a wide range of applications in the real life. However, how to use this powerful geometry tool effectively is
%still a delicate challenge because the situation in application can varies very different. What's
%more, there are also a lot of complicated restrictions and limitations in the application. For instance, when we apply the conformal map to the sensor network,
%the bottleneck is that no single sensor can afford the huge computation because
%each sensor has limited computational capacity.
%
%%The challenge for applying conformal map to other situations is that there is always a lot of restrictions for the detail application. For example, if we want to apply conformal map to the face registration, one problem we may encounter is that the face captured by 3D camera always have a lot of defects. Furthermore for some situations such as sensor network, the bottleneck is that no single sensor can afford the huge computation because each sensor has a limited capability of computation. For some applications such as real-time rendering, we also require the conformal map algorithm to be very efficient.

%%this thesis do
%Our contribution in this thesis is two-fold: On one hand we build a simple and local method to develop the extremal quasi-conformal map
%for the general surface with any restriction, where the conformal map does not exist; this is a state-of-art method for computing
%the extremal quasi-conformal map. As far as we know, for the first time we show the extremal quasi-conformal map on the general surface.
%
%On the other hand, we use the conformal map as a powerful tool for a variety of applications such as medical images, network and so on. For the medical image,
%We design the ingenious way to register two brainstem model and vestibular system with exact landmark matching, which takes the conformal map and extremal quasi-conformal map as basic tools.
%And the experimental result shows that our registration method can effectively detect the pathological shape morphing on these models.
%We also show that conformal map can be the useful geometry tool for constructing the
%general Droste effect and network routing. These work bring two benefits, one is that it opens a new gate for these subjects; For example, people can enjoy the work never seen before
% after we  introduce conformal map to the Droste effect. And another one is that we also enrich the practical algorithm library for computing conformal map by bringing the
% new stuff like the distributed algorithm for computing conformal map in sensor network routing.
%
%
%% Second,  when we apply conformal
%% map to the other application, this process is non-trial, and we develop a
%%new fast and efficient method to calculate the conformal map
%%according to the specific application, which also enriches the practical algorithm library for the conformal map theorem. For instance, we make a subtle decomposition
%%and turn the conformal map algorithm from Gu-Yau \cite{GuYau} to be a distributed algorithm, which makes it perfect for some applications such as sensor-network routing.
%
%%future work
%%Although we have made a great progress for conformal map on both theorem and application, but this work is far from finishing; there still be a lot of future work for us to do.
%%For instance, conformal map totally ignores the area distortion, which may lead to some problems if the shape between two surfaces has significant difference; under this situation,
%%we need to find the extremal quasi-conformal map under the limitation of area distortion bound.  and currently for our algorithm, we can not guarantee the map is bijective,
%%especially when the restriction introduce the great distortion. This will be a problem we need to solve in the future. In addition, we also need to
%%improve the speed for our algorithm to satisfy some application which need high efficient performance. For the application in real life, a lot of other real life application
%%like the registration analysis between the brain vessel, spline on the manifold and so on, can be improved or get great breakthrough with the powerful help of extremal quasi-conformal map.
